# Did not complete. Just looked at the numbers
# Plan for problem 67 is to find the maxes of each line and build
# heaviest line of the maxes only (ie this line includes 67 maxes)
# and try and build lines off the weightiest lines first idk

# Setup
x = input().split(' ')
triangle = []

# Massage the data. Make each list in triangle a row from triangle
add2 = 0
for i in range(15): # 15 rows
    add = 0 # The index that starts a new row in tri
    add2 += 1 # How many elements in that row
    for j in range(i):
        add += j
    add += i
    triangle.append(x[add: add + add2]) # start at row index and then add number of elements in that row. Pretty simple.
    
print(triangle)
