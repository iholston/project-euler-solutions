# 1) the square root of 1929394959697989990 (largest possible #) is ~1389026624 which means we can start here and go down
# 2) Doing a quick doodle, i noted that all numbers must end in 70 in order to get a 0 at then end
# with this in mind i created numbers 1XXXXXXX70 and the XXXXXXX started at 389026 and decremented
# as always i did this without looking for any help whatsoever, iv included my other horrifically solutions in this folder
