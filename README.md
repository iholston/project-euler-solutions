# Project-Euler-Solutions
My solutions to the project euler problems. Switches between Python and Golang every 25 problems. 

I specifically noted on the solution when I got help and tried to clearly show when I used outside research and/or 
algorithms that were not my own, seive of erathosthenes would be an example and all the combinations-ish (esk?) problems.

Otherwise (mainly), I did not get any outside help whatsoever to solve these problems.
