# Project-Euler-Solutions
My solutions to the project euler problems. Switches between Python and Golang every 25 problems.
I specifically noted on the solution when i got help or tried to show when i used algorithms that were not my own, 
seive of erathosthenes would be an example. Otherwise (mainly), I did not get any outside help whatsoever to solve these problems 
other than basic concepts relating to the problem, again seive of E would be an example of outside research to solve certain primes problems.
